## Motivation 
Traditional herbal medicine has been an inseparable part of the traditional medical science in many countries throughout 
history. Nowadays, the popularity of using herbal medicines in daily life, as well as clinical practices, has gradually expanded to 
numerous Western countries with positive impacts and acceptance. The continuous growth of the herbal consumption market has promoted 
standardization and modernization of herbal-derived products with present pharmacological criteria. To store and extensively share this 
knowledge with the community and serve scientific research, various herbal metabolite databases have been developed with diverse focuses 
under the support of modern advances. The advent of these databases has contributed to accelerating research on pharmaceuticals of natural 
origins. In the scope of this study, we critically review 30 herbal metabolite databases, discuss different related perspectives, and 
provide a comparative analysis of 18 accessible noncommercial ones. We hope to provide you with fundamental information and multidimensional 
perspectives from herbal medicines to modern drug discovery.

## Disclimer
Authors provide downloaded databases to users as data sources for future studies in natural drug discovery and related fields. The data were downloaded from open-sources for statistical analysis in the published paper entitled "[Plant Metabolite Databases: From Herbal Medicines to Modern Drug Discovery](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.9b00826)". When using these databases, please cite the original works of the database developers besides ours.
